I am a PhD student in Computational Mathematics at Monash University.

I am working under the supervision of Prof. Santiago Badia on the minimisation of energy functionals in nonlinear approximation spaces. My research focuses on 
* The design of nonlinear approximation spaces (neural networks, tensor-product free-knot B-splines, sparse grids),
* The minimisation of energy functionals coming from self-adjoint, elliptic partial differential equations in such spaces,
* The analysis of the stability and convergence of these schemes.
